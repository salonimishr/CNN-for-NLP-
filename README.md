# CNN-for-NLP-Classification

CNN is normally use in image classification. But it can also be use in NLP classification. In this project IMDB, Amazon, Yelp review data with label 
values 0 and 1 is used. 0 is for negative and 1 for positive. After cleaning and tokenizing data, neural networking applied and training model accuracy
of 1 is found and for test set it is 0.796. Neural network specificity, Precision, Recall(Sensitivity), accuracy are 0.833, 0.83 and 0.76. Keras is used of neural networking and 
Colab is used as platform
